# Patient Education - Hololens 2


## Aim: Use of Augmented Reality to Improve Patient Health Literacy in Neuromodulation


Despite proven efficacy and improvement in quality of life, advanced therapies in neurosurgery involving neuromodulation for the treatment of movement disorders, psychiatric disorders and epilepsy remain underutilized1,2. While the reasons for this are multifaceted (e.g. fear, access, communication barriers, education, trust, social support, physician bias), patient education remains central to improving health-literacy and physician-patient interactions3. Standardized content for patient education and engagement in neuromodulation is not well established. Without identifiable structural pathology and small surgical targets, patients often supplement with personal research. Additionally, there is growing emphasis on patient satisfaction as an indicator of quality, with perception of therapy and overall experience serving a key component in surgical outcome. Augmented reality (AR) is a versatile tool that can help address some of these gaps in care. AR is an interactive experience of a real-world environment where the objects that reside in the real world are enhanced by computer-generated perceptual information. In this study, our goal is to utilize an AR visualization system (HoloLensÂ® 2, Microsoft) to model neuromodulation therapies to help inform patients in clinic during pre-surgical evaluations. The model will be designed to help enhance comprehension with the goal of reducing procedural anxiety. Specifically, we will target three main neuromodulation surgeries: deep brain stimulation (DBS), responsive neurostimulation (RNS) and stereoencephalography (sEEG). 


Our specific aims are to:


Develop an AR system combined with a 3D printed model of the skull to supplement outpatient clinical visits to discuss neuromodulation surgery. Specifically, this model will utilize a generic 3D printed skull that will be used as a universal model. Three different holographic models will be made for the three targeted neuromodulation surgeries (DBS, RNS, sEEG) and overlayed onto the skull depending on the clinical visit and the surgery that is being discussed.


Assess the utility of the AR aid in improving patient education, perceived risk, comfort, and anxiety related to the specific procedure. We will randomize a cohort of patients undergoing evaluation for DBS, RNS or sEEG to 1 of 2 groups: an experimental group which will receive education using the AR system and a control group which will receive standard education alone. 


Using post-visit survey data we hypothesize that clinical visits supplemented with AR visual tools will improve patient understanding and comfort with surgery. Ultimately, by demonstrating improved understanding and comfort with neuromodulation surgery we hope to utilize AR based education in the clinical setting to improve access to these effective yet underutilized therapies. Finally, by establishing an effective model for pre-surgical patient education our future efforts will be to disseminate our system to other neurosurgical practices for multi-site evaluation. We would also target adapting our system to more readily accessible AR systems (i.e. smartphones) for patients to access outside of the clinical setting, and finally to model other surgery types beyond neuromodulation. Finally, a separate application of this approach will be to use this method of visualization to help in resident education as well as planning surgeries using patient specific anatomy.
